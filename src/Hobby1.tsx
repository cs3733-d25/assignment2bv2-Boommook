            <p>
                Ultimate frisbee, or just ultimate, is a non-contact sport played with a disc and two teams of seven.
                Ultimate is played on a field similar to football, though slightly shorter and slimmer, with endzones on both ends of the field.
                The length of games and points to win varies depending on level of play, though a typical game will end after either 90 minutes or
                a team reaches 15 points. Points are scored by catching the disc in the endzone, but once a player catches the disc, they can not move.
                The player holding the disc can only hold it for 10 seconds, so their defender will keep track of how long they have had the disc out loud.
                The team with possesion of the disc is trying to score, while the defending team is trying to catch the disc, force it to hit the ground,
                or stall of which cause a turnover and change of possesion.
